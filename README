This project is an interactive filter for pipes that enumerates stdin, and lets you pick the lines that go to stdout.

Currently these features are supported:
- Support multiple selections with comma separated syntax
	ex.
	Selection: 5,3,0
	Line5
	Line3
	Line0

- Support multiple selections appended to one another with '+' separated syntax.
	ex.
	Selection: 5 + 3 + 0
	Line5 Line3 Line0

- Support an "a" as a selection for all, which just spits out the list (only the number enumerated)
  At this point it would basically be like "head -nNUM"
  The difference is that you got so see what it was sending through first, and optionally decide to send only part, or nothing at all
