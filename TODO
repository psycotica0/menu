These are the features I intend to implement before declaring the project done.

- Stephen thinks this is a dumb feature, but I might consider adding ranges.
	ex.
	Selection: 2..6
	Line2
	Line3
	Line4
	Line5
	Line6
  I'm not quite sure how I would make a range be appended.
  Maybe I would do something crazy like
	ex.
	Selection: 2..4+
	Line2 Line3 Line4
