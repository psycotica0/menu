These are the features I intend to implement before declaring the project done.

- Support multiple selections with comma separated syntax
	ex.
	Selection: 5,3,0
	Line5
	Line3
	Line0

- Support multiple selections appended to one another with '+' separated syntax.
	ex.
	Selection: 5 + 3 + 0
	Line5 Line3 Line0

- Escape some characters
  Perhaps make a flag to escape them, or a flag to not escape them
	ex.
	echo "~/JoJo's Pictures" | menu 
	JoJo\'s\ Pictures

- Support an "a" as a selection for all, which just spits out the list (only the number enumerated)
  At this point it would basically be like "head -nNUM"
  The difference is that you got so see what it was sending through first, and optionally decide to send only part, or nothing at all

- Stephen thinks this is a dumb feature, but I might consider adding ranges.
	ex.
	Selection: 2..6
	Line2
	Line3
	Line4
	Line5
	Line6
  I'm not quite sure how I would make a range be appended.
  Maybe I would do something crazy like
	ex.
	Selection: 2..4+
	Line2 Line3 Line4
